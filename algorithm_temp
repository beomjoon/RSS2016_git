Input: C_1, C_2, \mathfrak{J}, k
For k steps,
	- Start with B_c
	- Choose an arm, according to B_c, breaking ties 
	  randomly, keeping track of the evaluated arms
	- Construct B_p values using the evaluated arms
	- Construct B = min Bc,Bp
	- Out of all the arms that have not been evaluated so far,
	  evaluate an arm according to B vals, 
	  breaking ties randomly, keeping track of the evaluated arms
Output: max(evaluated_arms)
